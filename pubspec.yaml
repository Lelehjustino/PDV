#   # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#   # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
#   # example:
#   # fonts:
#   #   - family: Schyler
#   #     fonts:
#   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#   #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#   #         style: italic
#   #   - family: Trajan Pro
#   #     fonts:
#   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#   #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#   #         weight: 700
